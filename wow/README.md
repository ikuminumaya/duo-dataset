# Wizard of Wikipedia Setting

## Overview
In the Wizard of Wikipedia setting, the user takes the role of an apprentice asking questions or sharing thoughts about a randomly assigned topic, while the dialogue system acts as a knowledgeable wizard.  
The system always initiates the conversation, drawing on background knowledge from the Multi-Source Wizard of Wikipedia (Ms.WoW) dataset.  
Both subjective and objective evaluations are included in this dataset.
